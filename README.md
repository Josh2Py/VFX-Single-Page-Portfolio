# VFX-Single-Page-Portfolio

This is a portfolio site that I had developed after I had graduated with my degree in Visual Effects and Motion Graphics. The Site showcases various works I created but also is my improvement on the design on my portfolio. The single page layout with with Javascript to start videos on hover and have a responsive design was an improvement over my previous multipage layout that did not incorpate JavaScript or media queries.
